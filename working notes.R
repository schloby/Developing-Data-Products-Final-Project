#Working notes for Final Project

#Baby hat pattern generator

Chose inches or cm at the beginning


#Select size but only one choice for now, baby

#Brim
#Select brim from Rolled, small rib (K1, P1), medium rib (K2, p2), large rib (K4, p4)
#Have it calculate the number of times to repeat

Cast on 64 stitches. 

#Select body from 
#Stockinette

#Striped?

Work in stockinette stitch until piece measures 4 ½” # Add cm

(5” if you started with a rolled brim).

Change stripes every two rows if striped

#Top decrease, is always the same

#If stripes:
#If you are working with small stripes, continue your stripe pattern.


Switch to dpn. *(k8, pm, k8) onto one needle,* repeat from * around. Decrease in front of each marker 
and at the end of each needle in the following manner:
    
Round 1: *k6, k2tog* across (56 sts)

Round 2: *k5, k2tog* across (48 sts)

Round 3: *k4, k2tog* across (40 sts)

Round 4: *k3, k2tog* across (32 sts)

Round 5: *k2, k2tog* across (24 sts)

Round 6: *k1, k2tog* across (16sts)

Round 7: *k2tog, rm* across (8 sts)

Round 8: *k2tog* across (4sts)

Place all 4 remaining sts on the same needle. Do not bind off.

#Chose from 

#Plain

With the four stitches on your needle, break off yarn leaving a 6” (cm) tail. 
Thread onto a tapestry needle and pull through remaining stitches.

#I-cord
When 4 stitches remain, leave them on dpn and work in I-cord for 4” (cm). Bind off. Tie resulting I-cord in a knot.

#Pom pom

Many knitting and craft stores carry

pompom makers, which will make your life a lot

easier. I recommend that you buy one and follow

the instructions from there. If you find yourself

without a pompom maker, all you need is some

cardboard, scissors, and a needle.

Take a piece of cardboard and cut two

identical circles a little larger than you want the

pompom to be. Cut a hole in the center of each

circle and hold them together. You should have two

matching donuts of cardboard.

Taking a needle and a long length of yarn,

thread the yarn through the center of the circles and

wrap it evenly around the edges. Continue this

process until there is no space left in the center.

Using a sharp pair of scissors, cut along the edge

where the two circles meet. You should see it start

to resemble a pompom.

When all the strings are cut, take a long

string, and tie it very tightly and securely between

the two circles. Remove the cardboard. Fluff up the

edges of the pompom and trim any long hairs if

necessary. If you find the pompom is too large,

simply trim it down to the appropriate size.

#Tassle


Cut a rectangular piece of cardboard to the

length of your finished tassel. Wrap your yarn

around the appropriate length many times, until the

width on one side is half of the total width you

want. Take a piece of yarn and tie a tight and secure

knot around one end of the tassel. Cut the yarn at

the opposite end. About ½” inch from the tied end,

wrap another piece of yarn around the entire body

of the tassel to form its head. Trim loose ends to an

even length. Use the string at the head to attach to



output$oid2<-renderPrint({
    if (x()>50) {
        "You entered a number greater than 10"
    } else {
        "You entered a number less than or equal to 10"
    }
})



Knit the required number of stitches. Do not turn.

Instead, slide your stitches to the other end of the

needle. Pull the string across the back of the first

stitches, and continue knitting. You should see a

knitted tube begin to develop.

Continue in this process until you’ve reached your

desired length, never turning your work.

Bind off in pattern.
